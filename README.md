## Installation

1) Copy the `Data` folder and all sub-folders and files to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II`.

2) Make a copy of your Diablo II shortcut. Right click your new Diablo II shortcut and add the `-direct` and `-txt` switches the `target` field. It should now look like `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Diablo II.exe" -direct -txt`.

## Notes

* If your Diablo II installation is not at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II` you will have to modify the file paths above accordingly.

* If you make the Heaven's Will, Nature's Kingdom, or Void runewords on a character, do not load that character without the using the mod pack or those items will disappear.

* The author does not know what will happen if you try to access multiplayer content using the mod pack.
